TO DO:

1. daily view
2. calendar view ;___;
3. services
4. add customer/company during reservation
5. reservation needs to say if customer or company is paying
6. need to know if passport/dni
7. need to know country/town

you could then iterate through your array of dates (first to create the headers) and then rooms times to fill the rows. 
then just check the hash if it gives you the current room for the current date.

benson: ok how about this. 
Generate an array of the dates you want to show in your controller then generate a hash with date => room and use those in your view.
<myobie> benson: one simplistic way would be to have a field with the name "new_company" or something similar and in the controller look for that param to create a company before you assign the habtm
<benson> myobie: hm that actually seems like a pretty easy way to do it
<benson> and just create the new company model in the customer's controller? 
<myobie> benson: it is an option
<myobie> benson: some people might make a strange attribute on customer and have that auto create a company, but I prefer to just be explicit in the controller with simple ruby code

    = form_for(:session, url: sessions_path) do |f| 

      = f.label :email 
      = f.text_field :email 

      = f.label :password
